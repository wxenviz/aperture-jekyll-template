			<p>My name is Jacob Radford, and I'm a meteorology Ph.D. student at North Carolina University. One of the emphases of my work is to improve the way that we visualize and communicate probabilistic weather forecasts. This site presents several different visualization techniques, both old and new, with the hope that weather forecasters and the general public gain a better appreciation of forecast uncertainty.</p>
